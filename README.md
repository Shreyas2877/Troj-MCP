# Macro-Man: Personal MCP Server & iOS App

A comprehensive project to build a personal Model Context Protocol (MCP) server deployed on AWS EC2 with a simple iOS frontend for seamless AI model interactions and service integrations.

## 🎯 Project Vision

Build a personal MCP server that acts as a universal interface between AI models and various services (existing or custom), with an intuitive iOS app for easy interaction. This setup will enable easy integration with any service while keeping all the complex MCP logic in the backend.
